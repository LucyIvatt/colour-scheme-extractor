A personal project that will creates a colour pallete when given a file. This will render an image, similar to a swatch palette, and show the hex codes underneath their respective colour. 

E.g. with 4 colours selected for the example image:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f04194b5-6f9a-401d-aec5-c778b12ca3cb" alt="pexels-photo" width="300"/>

<img width="623" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/623dd307-acd8-4889-90fa-9b645a892eb6">
